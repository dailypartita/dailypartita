### Nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, majoring in Biology And Medicine, I will achieve a Master's degree next year.
- I have an interdisciplinary background, I achieved Biotechnology Bachelor's degree at Huazhong Agricultural University, and learned biochemistry, cell biology, immunology, genetics and other biological theoretical foundations and experimental techniques. During my Master's degree, I elect lots of courses in Bioinformatics, including next/third-generation sequencing data analysis, bioinformatics databases, Python, data structures, algorithms and pattern recognition.
- I have a good command of programming, I can implement basic operations of common data structures and optimal solutions of classical algorithms and I can use dynamic programming and parallel computing to accelerate programs.
- I use Python & SnakeMake and R to build bioinformatics pipelines and statistical & machine learning models on the Linux platform in my daily work. In my spare time, I learned lots of programming languages such as C/C++, Java, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and lots of tools such as regular expression, SQL, Git, GitLab and Docker.
- I am good at experimental design and statistical analysis of experimental data, and I have led the R&D of two sequencing library prep kits.
- I am logical, I can grasp the crux of the problem and list most of the possibilities, then solve them with divide-and-conquer. I also good command of abstract thinking, I can identify the commonalities and differences between tasks and transfer knowledge to solve them.
- When facing difficulties, I am willing to consult others and teach my knowledge to others.
